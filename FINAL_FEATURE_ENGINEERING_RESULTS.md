## üß† **INTELLIGENT FEATURE SELECTION**

### **Recursive Optimization Process**
The system automatically tested different feature combinations and recursively removed features that didn't improve performance:

### **Final Optimal Feature Set (6 features):**
1. **`lat_ind_int`** - Latitude √ó Industrial proxy interaction
2. **`meteo_lon`** - Longitude √ó Meteorological season interaction  
3. **`traffic_ind_lon`** - Traffic √ó Industrial √ó Longitude interaction
4. **`cycle_interaction_2`** - Day-year sine √ó Hour cosine interaction
5. **`longitude`** - Base geographic coordinate
6. **`industrial_proxy`** - Industrial activity indicator

### **Why These Features Won:**
- **Geographic-Industrial Interactions**: Capture pollution hotspots
- **Complex Location-Time Patterns**: Model temporal-spatial dependencies
- **Meteorological Influences**: Account for seasonal weather patterns
- **Traffic-Industrial Synergy**: Capture combined emission sources
